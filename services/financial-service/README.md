# Financial Service API

## Overview

The Financial Service API is a robust and scalable backend service designed to simplify access to banking and financial information. By integrating with multiple financial data providers (Plaid, GoCardless, Teller, and Stripe), it offers a unified interface for developers to retrieve account information, transactions, balances, and more.

Built with TypeScript and deployed on Cloudflare Workers, this API provides a high-performance, globally distributed solution for fintech applications and services.

### Adding a New Provider

1. Create a new directory under `src/providers/` for the provider
2. Implement the provider API client, following the pattern in existing providers
3. Create transformation functions to standardize the provider's data format
4. Update the `Provider` interface in `src/providers/interface.ts`
5. Add the new provider to the `Providers` enum in `src/common/schema.ts`
6. Implement necessary route handlers in `src/routes/`
7. Add tests for the new provider in `tests/providers/`

### Coding Standards

- Follow the TypeScript best practices and coding style guide
- Maintain 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Document all public functions and classes using JSDoc comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### Performance Optimization

- Use caching strategies to reduce API calls to financial providers
- Implement request batching for bulk operations
- Utilize Cloudflare Workers' edge caching capabilities
- Optimize database queries and indexing
